# verilog-vending-machine
Vending machine project using Verilog HDL with simulation and testbench

This project simulates a vending machine using Verilog HDL. It handles ₹5 and ₹10 coin inputs and dispenses a bottle priced at ₹15, with change return logic.

## Features

* Coin input handling (₹5 and ₹10)
* State machine-based control logic
* Change return system
* Simulated using EDA Playground
* Testbench verification with waveform output

## Files Included

* Project Report (PDF)
* Verilog Design Code
* Testbench Code
* Waveform Screenshots
